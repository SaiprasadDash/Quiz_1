        <p class="p2">C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by
             Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating 
             system. The main features of C language include low-level access to 
             memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make 
             C language suitable for system programming like operating system or 
             compiler development.</p>

    <table><tr><th class="">Java has been one of the most popular programming language for 
        many years. Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as 
        pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types 
        (like int, char, etc) The Java codes are first compiled into byte code 
        (machine independent code). Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual 
        Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.</th>
